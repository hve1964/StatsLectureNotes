The first task at hand in unravelling the intrinsic structure 
potentially residing in a given raw data set 
$\{x_{i}\}_{i=1,\ldots,n}$ for some statistical variable $X$ 
corresponds to Cinderella's task of separating the ``good peas'' 
from the ``bad peas,'' and collecting them in respective bowls (or 
bins). This is to say, the first question to be answered requires 
determination of the \textbf{frequency} with which a value (or 
attribute, or category)~$a_{j}$ in the spectrum of possible values 
of $X$ was observed in a statistical sample 
$\boldsymbol{S_{\Omega}}$ of size~$n$.

frequencies}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\underline{\textbf{Def.:}} Let $X$ be a nominally, ordinally or
metrically scaled one-dimensional \textbf{statistical variable},
with a spectrum of $k$ different \textbf{values} or
\textbf{attributes} $a_{j}$ resp.\ $k$ different
\textbf{categories} (or bins) $K_{j}$ ($j=1,\ldots,k$). If, for
$X$, we have a univariate \textbf{raw data set} comprising
$n$ \textbf{observed values}~$\{x_{i}\}_{i=1,\ldots,n}$, we define
by
%
\be
o_{j}:=
\begin{cases}
o_{n}(a_{j}) & = \text{number\ of}\ x_{i}\ \text{with}
\ x_{i}=a_{j} \\
 & \\
o_{n}(K_{j}) & = \text{number\ of}\ x_{i}\ \text{with}
\ x_{i} \in K_{j}
\end{cases}
\ee
%
($j=1,\ldots,k$) the \textbf{absolute (observed) frequency} of $a_{j}$
resp.\ $K_{j}$, and, upon division of the $o_{j}$ by the sample 
size $n$, we define by
%
\be
\lb{eq:relfreq}
h_{j}:=
\begin{cases}
{\displaystyle \frac{o_{n}(a_{j})}{n}} & \\
 & \\
{\displaystyle \frac{o_{n}(K_{j})}{n}} &
\end{cases}
\ee
%
($j=1,\ldots,k$) the \textbf{relative frequency} of $a_{j}$
resp.\ $K_{j}$. Note that for all $j=1,\ldots,k$, we have $0 \leq 
o_{j} \leq n$ with $\displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{k}o_{j}=n$, and $0 
\leq h_{j} \leq 1$ with $\displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{k}h_{j}=1$.

\medskip
\noindent
The $k$ value pairs $(a_{j},o_{j})_{j=1,\ldots,k}$ resp.\ 
$(K_{j},o_{j})_{j=1,\ldots,k}$ represent the univariate \textbf{
distribution of absolute frequencies}, the $k$ value pairs 
$(a_{j},h_{j})_{j=1,\ldots,k}$
resp.\ $(K_{j},h_{j})_{j=1,\ldots,k}$ represent the univariate 
\textbf{distribution of relative frequencies} of the $a_{j}$
resp.\ $K_{j}$ in $\boldsymbol{S_{\Omega}}$.

It is standard practice in \textbf{Statistics} to compile from the 
univariate relative frequency distribution 
$(a_{j},h_{j})_{j=1,\ldots,k}$
resp.\ $(K_{j},h_{j})_{j=1,\ldots,k}$ of data for some ordinally 
or metrically scaled one-dimensional statistical variable $X$ the 
associated empirical cumulative distribution function. Hereby it 
is necessary to distinguish the case of data for a variable with a 
discrete spectrum of values from the case of data for a variable 
with a continuous spectrum of values. We will discuss this issue 
next.

\underline{\textbf{Def.:}} Let $X$ be an ordinally or metrically
scaled one-dimensional statistical variable, the spectrum of values 
$a_{j}$ ($j=1,\ldots,k$) of which vary \textit{discretely}. Suppose 
given for $X$ a statistical sample $\boldsymbol{S_{\Omega}}$ of 
size $|\boldsymbol{S_{\Omega}}|=n$ comprising observed values 
$\{x_{i}\}_{i=1,\ldots,n}$, which we assume arranged in an 
ascending fashion according to the natural order $a_{1} < a_{2} < 
\ldots < a_{k}$. The corresponding univariate relative frequency 
distribution is $(a_{j},h_{j})_{j=1,\ldots,k}$. For all real 
numbers $x \in \mathbb{R}$, we then define by
%
\be
\lb{eq:empvert}

the \textbf{empirical cumulative distribution function} for $X$.
The value of $F_{n}$ at $x \in \mathbb{R}$ represents the
cumulative relative frequencies of all $a_{j}$ which are less
or equal to $x$; cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:ecdf}. $F_{n}(x)$ has the
following properties:
%
\begin{itemize}

\item its domain is $D(F_{n})=\mathbb{R}$, and its range is 
$W(F_{n})=[0,1]$; hence, $F_{n}$ is bounded from above and from 
below,

\item it is continuous from the right and monotonously increasing,

\item it is constant on all half-open intervals $[a_{j},a_{j+1})$, 
but exhibits jump discontinuities of size $h_{n}(a_{j+1})$ at all 
$a_{j+1}$, and,

\item asymptotically, it behaves as ${\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 
-\infty}F_{n}(x)=0}$ and ${\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 
+\infty}F_{n}(x)=1}$.
